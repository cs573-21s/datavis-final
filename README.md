### Process Book

- Link to process book

### Project Website

You can find our visualization here: https://geacquista.github.io/datavis-final/

- interactive visualization
- summarize the main results of the project
- tell a story
- Consider your audience and keep the level of discussion at the appropriate level. 
- process book and data should be linked from the web site as well. 
- embed interactive visualization and your screen-cast in your website. 


### Project Screen-Cast

- Link to screen cast

Two minute screen-cast with narration showing a demo of your visualization and/or some slides. 

- good storytelling and presentations to get key points across
- majority of the screencast explains main contributions rather than technical details. 
- What do you feel is the best part of your project? 
- What insights did you gain? 
- What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away?

Requirements (for reference from original readme)
---

Store the following in your github repository:

- Code - All web site files and libraries assuming they are not too big to include
- Data - Include all the data that you used in your project. If the data is too large for github store it on a cloud storage provider, such as Dropbox or Yousendit.
- Process Book- Your Process Book in PDF format.
- README - The README file must give an overview of what you are handing in: which parts are your code, which parts are libraries, and so on. The README must contain URLs to your project websites and screencast videos. The README must also explain any non-obvious features of your interface.


Your process book should include the following topics. Depending on your project type the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:

- Overview and Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.
- Related Work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, visualizations we discussed in class, etc.
- Questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
- Data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: What visualizations did you use to initially look at your data? What insights did you gain? How did these insights inform your design?
- Design Evolution: What are the different visualizations you considered? Justify the design decisions you made using the perceptual and design principles you learned in the course. Did you deviate from your proposal?
- Implementation: Describe the intent and functionality of the interactive visualizations you implemented. Provide clear and well-referenced images showing the key design and interaction elements.
- Evaluation: What did you learn about the data by using your visualizations? How did you answer your questions? How well does your visualization work, and how could you further improve it?


Grading
---

- Prospectus - Did the prospectus contain sufficient thought, detail, and related work to facilitate a clear project plan?
- Process Book - Are you following a design process that is well documented in your process book?
- Solution - Is your visualization effective in answering your intended questions? Was it designed following visualization principles?
- Implementation - What is the quality of your implementation? Is it appropriately polished, robust, and reliable?
- Presentation - Are your web site and screencast clear, engaging, and effective?
Your individual project score will also be influenced by your peer evaluations.
